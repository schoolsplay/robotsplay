To get code completion and more goodies working in pycharm open the settings menu
and add the python-ev3 git repo as content-root.
Settings -> project structure -> add content root.

Install pycharm plugin: Source synchronizer

Things todo on your btick in addition to the stuff mentioned in th ev3 wiki
- dpkg-reconfigure tzdata to set the time and date to your locale
- update-rc.d rmnologin remove
- Create regular user:
  # adduser user
  Also add this user to the sudo group.
- Set the time on the brick, manually no need to run ntpd:
  sudo date +%T -s "8:08:00"
- install the eve ip2lcd script (see docstring inside this module)
  (it seems that the boot proccess is slower than the network connection so the
  message from ip2lcd is overwritten by the ev3 default message when the boot is finished.
  So i included a sleep of 5 seconds.
